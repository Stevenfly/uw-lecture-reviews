## 12. The Properties of Stars

### Distances to stars (5)

#### Fundamental distance determination is from stellar parallax

- The motion of the Earth around the Sun (once per year) causes an apparent motion of nearby stars relative to more distant "background" stars.
- Stars appear to move in a loop around the sky once per year.
- This "reflex" motion is called stellar parallax.

#### Trigonometric Parallax

- nearby stars will have a larger parallax
- nearest stars have a parallax less than 1 arcsec
- define a unit of distance: the **parsec** - objects that have parallax equals to 1.0 arcsec are at a distance of 1 parsec

```
parallax (radians) = 1.0 AU / distance
1 parsec = 206265 AU   =>   p (arcsec) = 1/d (pc)
                       =>   d = 1/p (arcsec)
```

### Brightness, luminosity, and colours of stars (10)

#### Brightness is provisional to $1/d^2$

- The light is spread out over a larger area as it travels further from its source, therefore the energy of the light falling on any one square is less for squares further from the source.
- $b = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$

#### Brightness versus Luminosity

- **Brightness**: total light energy is collected from an object: brighter => more light is collected.
  - <u>brightness depends on the distance</u> from the emitting object to the collecting detector.
  - brightness can also be affected if there is anything along the line of sight from emitter to collector that <u>blocks (absorbs or scatters)</u> some of the light.

#### Luminosity**: total light **emitted by the object = *intrinsic*

- depends <u>only</u> on the properties of the emitting object
- depends on surface emission properties and surface area

#### The magnitude system

- first defined bu Hipparcos (~100 BC) and refined by Ptolemy (~100 AD)
- scale set for naked-eye stars: brightest are *first* magnitude, faintest stars visible - *sixth* magnitude
- scale quantified by Herschel and Pogson (1856)
  - a *<u>first</u>* magnitude star is 1-- times brighter than a *<u>sixth</u>* magnitude star (i.e. is $m_1 - m_2 = 5$ then $b_2 / b_1$ = 100)
  - this logarithmic scale reflects how the eye responds: it converts <u>equal ratios of actual intensity</u> into <u>equal intervals of perceived intensity</u>.
- ==NOTE: we will not do magnitude calculations for this course==

#### magnitude and distance: Absolute magnitude

- apparent (or observed) brightness depends on distance. We call the observed brightness the **apparent magnitude**
- we define **absolute magnitude M** as the brightness (in magnitudes) that a star would have at distance d = 10 pc and it relates directly to the luminosity of the star.

#### The colours of Stars

- A star's "colour" is a direct measure of its temperature
  - red stars are cooler than blue stars (~BB, Wien's Law)
  - the reddest stars are probably a few $\times 10^3 K$
  - bluest stars are probably a few $\times 10^4 K$
- also, there are processes that can change the colour of the light - especially: dust grains in interstellar space can "redden" starlight
- we can measure the brightness in a particular range of wavelengths and compare - say brightness in blue vs. red
  - the measured brightness in two different wavelength ranges gives the colour of the object
  - simplistically: if a star is measured to be brighter in the blue (more energy) than in the red, then we say that the star is blue - it is hotter
  - we can quantify this => colour scale

#### BB spectra: reminder

- hotter sources are brighter (emit more energy) at all $\lambda$
- Emission = $\sigma T^4$
- $\lambda_{max} (nm) = 2900000/T (K)$

#### Measuring the colours of stars

- colour is the ratio of the brightnesses in two wavelengths - or the magnitude difference

### Classification of spectra from stars (21)

#### Stars are nearly black bodies but not quite

- spectral lines cause a star's spectral hope to deviate slightly from BB curve - generally more in the red than blue
- a star's spectrum tells us more about the star than just a surface temperature

#### Stellar Spectra

- three kinds of spectra (Lecture 5)
  - <u>continuous</u>: emission at all wavelengths (e.g. a blackbody) formed by hot solid to hot high pressure gas
  - <u>emission</u> line: each element, as a hot low pressure gas, emits at unique set of wavelengths (determined by the energy levels occupied electrons)
  - <u>absorption line</u>: each element, as a cool low pressure gas will absorb at a unique set of wavelengths  from a continuous spectrum
- stars can produce all three kinds of spectra - but most produce an absorption (i.e. a continuous spectrum with absorption lines) spectrum
  - the wavelength patterns in the lines give the elements in the cooler outer layers of the star
  - the strengths of the lines tell us about the density and temperature where the lines are formed and also the amount of the elements present

#### Stellar spectra vs. Photometry

- Spectra
  - show detailed lines and line structure
  - can determine chemical abundances, rotation, magnetic field strength, radial velocity and more
  - spreads star's light out to see details => need bigger telesopes
- Photometry
  - good estimates of temperature
  - chemical abundances - only very roughly
  - can use smaller telescopes, observe more stars

```
For big, large-scale surveys	=>	photometry good
For mroe detailed information	=>	spectra better
```

### The Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram (29)

#### Absolute Magnitude vs. Spectral Type: the HR Diagram

- first plotted by Hertzsprung (1905) and Russell (1913) -> now called the HR diagram
- <u>vertical axis</u>: **luminosity** (absolute brightness) -> $M_V$ absolute magnitude in $V$
- <u>horizontal axis</u>: originally **spectral type** (now also **T**, **colour**)

#### Modern HR Diagram

- absolute magnitudes based on parallax distances from Hipparcos staellite
- colours => density of points red highest

#### schematic HR diagram showing the main features

- not a scatter plot; large "empty" areas
- most starts lie along a **main sequence** (MS)
- MS is a **mass** sequence
- other major regionsL giant, supergiant, white dwarf are different evolutionary stages with a wide range of amss
- **radius lines "diagonal"**

#### HR Diagram: stellar L, T, R

- Remember: luminosity depends on both energy emitted/area and surface area
- For a spherical BB: $L = 4\pi R^2 \times \sigma T^4$
- stars are moderately good blackbodies
- stars with same surface temperature (colour) but different luminosities must have different radii; also different densities.

#### nearby binary system Sirius A, B

- radius difference is real
- Sirius A: hot MS star with $R$~$2R_{Sun}$
- Sirius B: hot white dwarf star with $R$~$0.008R_{Sun}$

#### HR diagram of the nearest stars

- <u>sample bias = distance</u>
- nearest stars are mostly faint MS - low mass, less massive than the Sun
- a few white dwrfs
- a few brighter MS stars
- no massive MS stars, no giants or supergiants

#### HR diagram of the brightest stars

- <u>sample bias = apparent brightness</u>
- brightest stars are mostly luminous stars
- on MS all much more massive than the sun
- also giants, supergiants
- no intrinsically faint stars (i.e. low MS, WD)

#### What is the Main Sequence?

- The place where esters spend most of their lives
- The most massive stars are the most luminous (brightest), and hottest (blue)
- The lowest mass stars are faint, cool, and red
- Strs do not move (much) on the Main Sequence - they start close one spot on this diagram for most of their lives.

### Motions of stars (38)

#### Stellar Motions: all stars move

- measure components: radial velocity (Doppler shift) and "transverse" velocity (across the line of sight)
- can measure transverse velocity only if the star is moving fast and is close to us ("proper motion")
- without motion, gravity acting between all of the stars would bring them together
- motions of stars tell us something about the gravity acting on the stars - if there is more motion (higher velocities) then there is stronger gravity (more mass)
  - binary star orbits => stellar mass
  - internal motions of stars in clusters => cluster masses
  - motions of stars around the galaxy => galaxy mass
- statistical studies of the motions of stars are sued as well.

#### Radical versus transverse motion

- illustrated on page 39

### Groups of stars (41)

#### Binary Stars

- two (or more) stars in orbit around a common centre of mass.
- various possible cases:
  - <u>visual binary</u>: both stars visibly orbiting each other.
  - <u>astrometric binary</u>: only one star is visible - the one star moves around in the sky in a loop or wave.
  - <u>spectroscopic binary</u>: only one star is visible; it shows no visible motion, but from tis septum one can see a regular periodic motion from doppler shifts; sometimes only brighter star's spectrum is seen, sometimes both.
  - <u>eclipsing binary</u>: one star passes "in front" of the other, blocking some of the light reaching us and causing a change in the system's brightness

#### Visual Binaries

- **binary star systems**: can be used to measure the mass of the stars
- in a visual binary sytem the stars are resolved
- period determined from motion of one star about the other
- mass ratio from relative orbital scales
- **need to know distance to determine "true" masses**

#### Spectroscopic Binary System

- in a spectroscopic binary we observe periodic changes in spectral line wavelengths
- timescale => orbital period
- amplitude => orbital scale
- amplitude ratio => mass ratio

#### Eclipsing Binary System

- in an eclipsing binary we observe periodic changes brightness: eclipses
- timescale => orbital period
- eclipsing timing => ratio of radii
- eclipse depth + radius => temperature and luminosity ratios
- if also spectroscopic true radii + mass => densities
- **previous/other knowledge of distance not needed if system is both eclipsing and spectroscopic**

### Miscellaneous

- **â‰¥ 90% of stars have mass < 1**$M_{Sun}$
- **Stellar radii can be as small as a planet to as big as Mars' orbit**
- **Are all strs on the Main Sequence the same mass?**
  - The most luminous stars are those with the most mass.
- The lifetimes of stars depend on (1) the amount of fuel (mass) and (2) the rate at which the star uses up that fuel (luminosity)
  - Result: the most massive stars have the shortest lives

### Summary (51)

- We can measure the brightness, colour, and spectra of any star that we can see
- To measure the mass of a star it must be in orbit around another star (binary star)
- However we <u>**assume**</u> that if two stars are identical in luminosity and spectra then they are identical in mass too.
