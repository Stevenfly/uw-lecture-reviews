## 3.1 transport-layer services

- A <u>transport-layer protocol</u> provides for __logical communication__ between application processes running on different hosts.
- On the sending side, the transport layer converts the application-layer messages it receives from a sending application process into transport-layer packets, known as transport-layer **segments**.
- It's important to note that network routers act only on the network-layer fields of the datagram; that is, they do not examine the fields of the transport-layer segment encapsulated with the datagram.

### 3.1.1. Relationship between Transport and Network Layers

- A <u>network-layer protocol</u> provides logical communication between *hosts*.
- Household analogy: the services that a transport protocol can provide are often constrained by the service model of the underlying network-layer protocol.

### 3.1.2 Overview of the Transport Layer in the Internet

- __UDP__ (User Datagram Protocol), which provides an unreliable, connectionless service to the invoking application.
- __TCP__ (Transmission Control Protocol), which provides a reliable, connection-oriented service to the invoking application.
- We refer to the transport-layer packet as a *segment*, reserve the term *datagram* for the network-layer packet.
- __IP__ (Internet Protocol) provides logical communication between hosts. The IP service model is a __best-effort delivery service__. This means that IP makes its "best effort" to deliver segments between communicating hosts, *but it makes no guarantees*. In particular, it does not guarantee
  - segment delivery,
  - orderly delivery of segments, and
  - the integrity of the data in the segments.
- IP is said to be an __unreliable service__. *Each host has an IP address.*
- The most fundamental responsibility of UDP and TCP is to extend IP's delivery service between two end systems to a delivery services between two processes running on the end systems. Extending host-to-host delivery to processs-to-process delivery is called __transport-layer multiplexing__ and __demultiplexing__.
- UDP: only two transport-layer services
  - process-to-process data delivery
  - error checking (segment header)
- TCP
  - reliable data transfer (flow control, sequence numbers, acknowledgements, and timers).
  - congestion control

## 3.2 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

- At the receiving end, the transport layer examines these fields to identify the receiving socket and then directs the segment to that socket. This job of delivering the data in a trasnport-layer segment to the correct socket is called __demultiplexing__.

- The job of gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information (that will later be used in demultiplexing) to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer is called __multiplexing__.

- Transport-Layer multiplexing requires

  - (1) that sockets have unique identifiers, and
  - (2) that each segment have special fields that indicate the socket to which the segment is to be delivered. These special fields are the __source port number field__ and the __destination port number firld__.

  ```
  (total 32 bits)
  
  Source port # | Dest. port #
  Other header fields
  Application data (message)
  ```

- The port numbers ranging from 0 to 1023 are called __well-known port numbers__ and are restricted.

#### Connectionless Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

```c++
clientSocket = socket(socket.AF_INEF, socket.SOCK_DGRAM);
clientSocket.bind(('', 19157))
```

- A UDP socket is fully identified by a two-tuple consisting of a destination IP address and a destination port number. As a consequence, if two UDP segments have different source IP addresses and/or source port bunkers, but have the <u>same *destination* IP address and *destination* port number</u>, then the two segments will be directed to the same destination process via the <u>same destination</u> socket.

#### Connection-Oriented Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

```c++
// request
clientSocket = socket(AF_INEF, SOCK_STREAM);
clientSocket.connect((serverName, 12000));
// creates a new socket
connectionSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept();
```

- One subtle difference between a TCP socket and a UDP socket is that a TCP socket is identified by a four-tuple: (source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number)
- Two arriving TCO segments with different source IP addresses or source port numbers will (with the exception of a TCP segment carrying the original connection-establishment request) be directed to two different sockets.

## 3.3 Connectionless Transport: UDP

- Many applications are better suited for UDP for the following reasons:
  - *Finer application-level control over what data is sent, and when.* As soon as an application process passes data to UDP, UDP will package the data inside a UDP segment and immediately pass the segment to the network layer.
  - *No connection establishment*. UDP does not introduce any delay to establish a connection.
  - *No connection state*. A server devoted to a particular application can typically support many more active clients when the application runs over UDP rather than TCP.
  - *Small packet header overhead*. TCP segment has 20 bytes of header overhead in every segment, whereas UDP has only 8 bytes of overhead.

### 3.3.1 UDP Segment Structure

```
(total 32 bits)

Source port # | Dest. port #
Length        | Checksum
Application data (message)
```

### 3.3.2 UDP Checksum

- The UDP checksum provides for error detection. The checksum is used to determine whether bits within the UDP segment have been altered (e.g. by noise in the link or while stored in a router) as it moved from source to destination.
- At the receiver, all four 16-bit words are added, including the checksum. If no error are introduced into the packet, then clearly the sum at the reviewer will be `1111111111111111`.
- <u>The reason (of error checking in UDP)</u> is that there is no guarantee that all the links between source and destination provide error checking; that is, one of the links may use a link-layer protocol that does not provide error checking. Furthermore, even if segments are correctly transferred across a link, it's possible that bit errors could be introduced when a segment is stored in a router's memory.
- This is an example of the celebrated __end-end principle__ in system design [Saltzer 1984], which states that since certain functionality (error detection, in this case) must be implemented on an end-end basis: *"functions placed at the lower levels may be redundant or of little value when compared to the cost of providing them at the higher level."*
